# Bucket Academy build-loop log

Each entry = one autonomous run. Newest at bottom.

## 2026-06-11 — seed (by Nucleus, in-session)
Shipped P1 app: FSRS-5 scheduler, foundations-first route gen with nucleus leverage
scoring, 33-atom biophysics corpus (5 prereq / 23 nucleus / 5 frontier), 3-depth atom
screens + KaTeX + retrieval drills, concentric-shell nucleus map, progress/streak/XP,
PWA offline. validate.sh passes (JSON + JS syntax + 60-day engine sim). Commits 407b261,
6074b8d.
NEXT: expand biophysics corpus toward full syllabus coverage (spectroscopy: Bragg/NMR/
FRET/cryo-EM-CTF; Poisson–Boltzmann; Kramers; Smoluchowski; Helfrich; GHK; cable eqn;
Monte Carlo; FEP/WHAM; Markov state models; contact order; RMSF). Then start a second
branch corpus (math or physics) + a branch picker in the UI.

## 2026-06-11 — run 1 (corpus expansion: spectroscopy + stochastic dynamics)
Added 8 nucleus atoms, 33 → 41. Spectroscopy methods (syllabus §1.8, was entirely
empty): `bragg` (X-ray diffraction + phase problem), `nmr-noe` (chemical shift + r⁻⁶
NOE ruler), `fret` (Förster ruler, E=1/(1+(r/R₀)⁶)), `cryo-em-ctf` (single-particle +
CTF correction). Stochastic dynamics (§1.5/1.9 gaps): `poisson-boltzmann` (requires
debye; Debye length as its linearized limit), `langevin` (fluctuation–dissipation),
`smoluchowski-rate` (k=4πDR diffusion-limited binding; requires fick+einstein-stokes),
`kramers` (friction-corrected TST; requires langevin+eyring). All have clean requires-
edges into existing nucleus atoms, 3 depths, 2 varied-level quiz items, OPEN sources
only, art_prompt. validate.sh PASSES (41 atoms, no dupes/missing, 60-day sim introduces
all 41). Commit d0476a5.
NEXT: still-thin biophysics topics — Helfrich membrane elasticity (requires bilayer),
GHK equation (requires nernst), cable equation (requires hodgkin-huxley), Monte Carlo +
FEP/WHAM free-energy methods + Markov state models (requires md), contact order, RMSF.
After ~1–2 more biophysics batches, START A SECOND BRANCH: create app/corpus/01-mathematics.json
or 02-physics.json (6–12 seed atoms, same schema) + a branch-picker in the UI (engine.js
currently hardcodes biophysics.json — see js/engine.js load()).
